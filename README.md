# MVSinnerEarCorr
The data and MATLAB codes for the statistical analysis presented in the submission to JOON 2020.
Here we investigate correlations of the inner ear anatomy (horizontal Semi-Circular Canal (hSCC) angle) and Reid's plane with amplitudes
of RS-fMRI activity. In other words, we are looking for the effect of MVS on RS-fMRI activity using the parameters associated with the origin of MVS.
