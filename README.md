# MVSinnerEarCorr
The data and MATLAB codes for the statistical analysis presented in the submission to JOON 2020.
Here we investigate correlations of the inner ear anatomy (horizontal Semi-Circular Canal (hSCC) angle) and Reid's plane with amplitudes
of RS-fMRI activity. In other words, we are looking for the effect of MVS on RS-fMRI activity using the parameters associated with the origin of MVS.

The data is in the mat-file "dataReAnalysis.mat".
Put the mat-file in the same folder as the script "reAnalysisROIs_NEWangles_and_orgCovars.m" and run the script.
See comments in the script for further options.
NB: I used MATLAB R2019b with the statistics and machine learning toolbox, nothing further needed.

Best,
